# Bank Client Subscription Prediction System

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts whether a bank client will subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic, contact, and economic indicators.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline
- Ordinal Encoding for categorical features
- Feature Scaling using StandardScaler
- Ensemble Model for robust prediction
- Feature alignment to prevent deployment mismatches

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit

## 🚀 Deployment
The model is deployed using Streamlit with a professional user interface for real-time prediction.

## 📊 Output
